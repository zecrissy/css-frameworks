                <p><span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;">Scooters </span> are reall fun, but an electric 
                    scooter is so much more fun! At work, I have to park about five to ten minutes away from my building. 
                    Imagine walking in the heat, on the black asphalt four times a day. I said, "no thank you" and I came 
                    up with a solution. </p>
                <blockquote>My solution was an <strong>ELECTRIC SCOOTER! </strong> One hurtle was the price tag. Did I really 
                    want to pay a lot of money to save me twenty to forty minutes a day? Was it really worth the investemnt? I 
                    had to make sure this was going to be worth it.

                <p>I spend days looking up different types of electric scooters. Some of the feautures I notices were, pneumatic 
                    tires, app sync, front and back suspension, front and rear breaking, and of course speed. To find out if it 
                    was worth the expense, check out my second article, <strong>Electric Scooter Review.</strong> </p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;">Excited </span> is definetly the word I would use 
                    to describe my emotions. I couldn't wait to get it in the mail and try it out. Of course I had to 
                    practice at home fist to get a hang of it and that's what I did. I lost control twice and almost 
                    fell off going 15 mph! Luckily I was able to recover and got a sore leg.</p>
                <blockquote>The first day at work was<strong> nerve wracking.</strong> I did not want to fall in front 
                    of all my co-workers. However, I stayed calm and rode my scooter to my building. It was amazing! I 
                    got to the office in about fifteen seconds! I saved so much time!

                <p>I don't regret it at all. It was so worth every penny. It is a bit bummpy on the road, but I don't 
                    mind it. With tempatures rising to 107 degrees, it's a life saver. Now I can park far where the 
                    trees are to have some shade for my van and still get to work on time.</p>
